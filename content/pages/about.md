## Tour Policy

The School of Computer Science and all divisions frequently receive requests for public tours. While we cannot accommodate all requests, periodic tours are only offered to groups by prior arrangement. To inquire further, please contact us at [scs-tours@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:scs-tours@cs.cmu.edu).

PROSPECTIVE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS

*   Official tours of the Computer Science facilities for high school students are offered during [Turn Tartan Overnight Weekends](https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/turn-tartan-overnight). Please visit [University Admissions](https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/turn-tartan-overnight) for the schedule and additional information.
*   Prospective students who cannot visit during Turn Tartan Overnight Weekends may schedule a 1/2 hour appointment to speak to a representative in the Computer Science Department, who can provide an overview of our program and answer your questions. We also offer a self-guided tour of our buildings. To schedule an appointment, please contact [Mary Widom.](mailto:marywidom@cs.cmu.edu)
*   [Campus tours for prospective students](http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/events) can be scheduled through the university’s Undergraduate Admissions office.

THE ROBOTICS INSTITUTE

The Robotics Institute often hosts an open house during the university’s annual Spring Carnival (held in April)_._ The details on this event are posted on the [](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/event_sub.html?menu_id=240) [Robotics Institute website](http://www.ri.cmu.edu) as the registration date approaches.

Please note, most of our robots are located within laboratories and are not readily accessible to the public. But Tank_,_ the Roboceptionist (an interactive social robot) operates on most weekdays at the third-floor entrance to Newell-Simon Hall. HERB, the home exploring robot butler, is a two-armed, mobile robot that can be viewed through the glass walls of the Personal Robotics Lab on the fourth floor of Newell-Simon Hall. Both robots invite you to visit.

Thank you for your interest in all our programs. If you have additional questions related to tours please [contact us](mailto:scs-tours@cs.cmu.edu).
