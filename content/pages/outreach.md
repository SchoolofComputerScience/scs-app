# SCS Outreach Programs

Careers in the so-called “STEM” fields—science, technology, engineering and math—are a major driving force of the 21st century economy. That's why the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University is part of a multi-faceted effort to attract more students to study STEM fields such as computing, information technology and robotics, and to retain those students. Our outreach programs have been developed over more than a decade. They reach across disciplines and into communities across the United States, starting with educational programs for teachers and students in primary school right up into high school. We pay particular attention to encouraging more participation by women and under-represented minorities—not by watering down the lessons, but by giving students the fundamental tools they need to succeed.

Let's Go Lab is a research project on speech interfaces and dialog systems conducted by researchers from the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. Funding for Let's Go Lab comes from the U.S. National Science Foundation. The objective of the Let's Go! project is to create a basic dialog system that extreme populations such as the elderly and non-natives can access. Though the original Let's Go! project is now over, you can use the Let's Go! system for your own research.

ACTIVATE is a series of three free workshops offered for high-school teachers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in the northern Appalachian region surrounding Pittsburgh, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and western Maryland. The workshops will cover computing with Alice, Computational Thinking with Python, and Java programming for math and science. Accepted teachers will learn how to integrate computing topics and skills into their STEM classes to increase student interest in computing as a field of study in college and as a potential career path. All costs will be paid for by a grant from the National Science Foundation. These workshops will provide modest stipends for participating teachers to complete surveys during and after the workshop to evaluate the use of the presented material in the classroom. (This work is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation - DRL-0833496.)
