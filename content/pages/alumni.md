### Engagement's Mission

In the SCS Office of Engagement and Annual Giving, we know that our graduates are our best and most important resource for helping current students change the world. We aim to connect you with the most meaningful opportunities to give back — whether it's mentoring current students or donating to a fund that's important to you. We're here to help.

# Current Funds

_A portion of your gift to Carnegie Mellon is allocated to our Administrative Fee._

### The CSD50 Graduate Fellowship Endowment Fund

All SCS Ph.D. students should have the chance to create the Next Big Thing, to engage openly in intellectual inquiry without worrying about losing their funding. We want them to freely explore. We want them to change the world.

SCS created the CSD50 Graduate Fellowship Endowment Fund to guarantee that each Ph.D. student has the support to fuel their research and exploration while at CMU. Contributions to the fund will help us attract, retain and support the best computer scientists in the world as they create the future.

When you give to the CSD50 Graduate Fellowship Endowment Fund, you not only support the future of computer science, but you can recognize the contributions of individuals with deep SCS roots. We've specifically highlighted four individuals you can honor with your gift: Sharon Burks, A. Nico Habermann, [Raj Reddy](/directory/raj_reddy) and Joe Traub. You can make your gift by clicking below and specifying one of these SCS legends in the "Comments" box on the next page.

### SCS Fund

Many SCS donations come with limitations: they can only be used for specific purposes or within specific departments or for specific types of students. The SCS Fund is just that — a fund that can be used for nearly any need that arises in the School of Computer Science. The SCS Fund provides the flexibility to ensure the school's day-to-day needs are met and that everyone has the tools they need to be successful in the classroom and in their research efforts.

### The Mark Stehlik SCS Alumni Undergraduate Impact Scholarship

The [Mark Stehlik SCS](/directory/mark_stehlik) Alumni Undergraduate Impact Scholarship recognizes and supports SCS undergraduates whose reach for excellence extends beyond the classroom — who are working to make a difference both in the field of computer science and the world around them. The award, created by the SCS Alumni Advisory Board, encourages SCS undergraduates to increase their engagement in research and community service, and to reach beyond their courses and grades. It shows the best and brightest SCS students that the community supports their tireless efforts to excel in all they do. And it’s appropriately named for former Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Education , who was a tireless force for encouraging a generation of students to shine in computer science, extracurricular activities and life.

To date, the fund has raised gifts and commitments totaling roughly $70,000.

Gillian Rosen (CS 2016) received the inaugural [Mark Stehlik SCS](/directory/mark_stehlik) SCS Alumni Impact Scholarship in the spring of 2016. Rosen embodies the spirit of the scholarship, which honors students who excel both in and out of the classroom. During her time at Carnegie Mellon, Rosen has performed undergraduate research with Robotics Professor [Howie Choset](/directory/howard_choset), and has participated in countless activities on campus, including driving for buggy.

### The Dean's Innovation Fund

Sometimes the most exciting research ideas don't meet the criteria for government funding, or they exist outside the limits of current budget restrictions. The Dean's Innovation Fund supports these sorts of initiatives and does so with an agility not often possible with other forms of sponsored research.

This fund also allows the dean to support efforts that improve the quality of life for SCS graduate and undergraduate students. For example, once upon a time a faculty member had a cool idea that received funding from the Dean's Innovation Fund. That cool idea turned into DuoLingo.
