### Test Scores

**All test scores must be uploaded (as a PDF) to your application. If they are not uploaded by December 15, you will not have access to upload them and your application may not be considered.**

All applicants must take the [Graduate Record Examination](http://www.ets.org/gre/)(GRE) general test and have scores. **Please send via mail at the time of application.** See individual program requirements for complete details. Please refer to the GRE testing schedule to determine test dates. No application will be considered complete until we have received these scores. GRE scores will not be accepted if they are more than five years old.

If your native language is not English, then you must submit the[Test of English as a Foreign Language](http://www.ets.org/toefl/)(TOEFL). All students will need to submit a TOEFL. **N****o exceptions**.

If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S. and your native language is not English, the TOEFL is still required. However, you may submit an expired test score up to five years old.

If you have not completed a bachelor’s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit a TOEFL **no older than two years. We will NOT accept an expired score in this case. No exceptions.**

**Send test scores via mail at the time of application.** A successful applicant will normally have a total iBT score of at least 100. We prefer that you take the TOEFL, but we will accept the [International English Language Testing System](https://www.ielts.org/) (IELTS). The same restrictions of expiration dates apply with an IELTS.

**Upload your GRE and TOEFL (if applicable) to your application no later than December 15\. Send the scores via mail at the time of application.**

**Please send your scores to the following codes:**

_GRE Institution Code: 2074; Department Code: 0402_

_TOEFL Institution Code: 4256; Department Code: 78_

**All <u>electronic</u> transcripts should be uploaded by the time you submit your application. If they are not uploaded by December 15, you will not have access to upload them and your application may not be considered.** Since fall grades are not required, upload your electronic transcripts as early as possible. **N****ote that electronic transcripts and test scores are not marked as received until you submit and pay your application**. It may take several days or weeks to check the uploaded material, please allow time.

### Resume

Submit your current Resume. Outline your education, research experience, work experience, publications, scholarships awarded, prizes and honors received, society memberships, and any other extracurricular activities.

### Statement of Purpose

Submit a Statement of Purpose. Prepare a concise one or two page essay that describes your primary areas of interest in research, your related experiences, and your objective in pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon. Your essay should be specific in describing your interests and motivations. When describing your research interests, you should explain why you think they are important areas of study and why you are particularly well-suited to pursuing them. You should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government, or teaching experience. If you are applying to more than one program, you may (but are not required to) submit a separate Statement of Purpose for each program. You must upload your Resume and Statement of Purpose in either PDF, MS Word, or text format. Include your name and User ID on the essay.

### Notes for specific programs:

*   **Human-Computer Interaction applicants:** Indicate your intended area of emphasis in the first paragraph of your Statement of Purpose. If appropriate to your background, you may include a link to your portfolio. If you are unable to provide a link, you may mail a CD of your portfolio to the Applications Coordinator. Contact [applygrad@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:applygrad@cs.cmu.edu) for mailing instructions.
*   **Software Engineering applicants:** Concisely summarize your background in software development, experience with particular parts of the software life cycle, and how your industrial experience prepares you for graduate-level academic work. Submit this information in the Supplemental Information section under Experience (Research, Industry) in the online application.
*   **Computation, Organizations and Society applicants**: Indicate your intended area in the first paragraph of your Statement of Purpose along with the name of a possible advisor. For those with industrial or government experience, describe how this experience prepares you for graduate-level academic work. Submit this information in the Supplemental Information section under Experience (Research, Industry) in the online application. Applicants may also submit a short prior publication related to their research interests.
*   **Master's in Robotics System Development applicants:** Provide some background information on your academic/industrial career to date, and why/how that leads you to be interested in CMU's unique industry-oriented MRSD degree-program. In order to aid in our candidate evaluation it would be helpful for us to understand your career aspirations, how you see the mix of technical/management education in the MRSD-program assisting you in achieving these, and what you see yourself doing in 5 to 10 years after graduation.
*   **Master's in Computer Science applicants:** Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in Computer Science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.

### Letters of Recommendation

Submit three letters of recommendation. Recommenders should know you relatively well and be able to evaluate the quality of your previous work. At least two should be from faculty or recent employers. With the online application, letters will be requested and submitted electronically. Paper recommendations will not be accepted. Letters of recommendation are due by **December 15**. All deadlines are final. Letters received after this date may not be considered in the review of your application.
