### Are there additional financial aid forms to complete?

No.

* * *

### I have my User ID and Password, but I cannot access the online application. What is the problem?

If your browser accepts cookies and you are not behind a firewall, then you should be able to login successfully. Also, make sure you are using the same website to login that you used to register. If you continue to have problems, send email to [applygrad@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:applygrad@cs.cmu.edu).

* * *

### What if all of my supporting documents do not arrive by the deadlines?

They may not be considered in the review of your application. It is your responsibility to make certain that your application is complete and that the required materials reach us by the above stated deadlines. You may use your User ID and Password to check your submitted application to make certain that it is complete.

* * *

### Can I make changes to my online application after it has been submitted?

You may return and make changes to your submitted application until the final deadline, December 15\. No changes will be allowed after this date.

* * *

### Can I transfer into a master's program from another college/university?

You may not simply transfer to a program. You must submit an application and be accepted into the program.

### If I applied last year and was not admitted, can I reapply this year?

Yes, as long as it is before **December 15\.** However, all application materials must be re-uploaded online and test scores should be re-sent. This includes the resume, statement of purpose, test scores, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and the application fee.

* * *

* * *

### How long does it take to complete a master's program?

About 1-2 years.

* * *

### Is it possible to work on a master's degree part time?

Most of our programs require that you be here full time.

* * *

### Is it possible to visit the campus and the School of Computer Science?

We ask that you wait until you have been admitted to a program before you visit. If admitted, you will be notified in late January or early February and invited to attend our Open House. We then make all travel and hotel reservations, as well as schedule appointments with faculty members and graduate students. If you are going to be in the Pittsburgh area at any time, you are welcome to stop by the School of Computer Science. However, we will not be able to make any appointments for you at that time.

* * *

### Should I contact faculty members directly?

You should feel free to contact professors with very specific questions about their research. However, we do request that you not ask to be accepted by a particular faculty member as a student, since under our admissions system individual faculty members do not make admissions decisions. Selection is by decision of the Admissions Committee, and students are not assigned an advisor until the beginning of the fall semester — after having an opportunity to attend project presentations by all faculty. You may obtain email addresses for anyone in the School of Computer Science (SCS) from the [directory](/directory).

* * *

### Will I be considered for financial support if I am admitted?

No. master's programs generally do not offer financial aid.

* * *

## Programs

### Where do I look for more detailed information on each of the master's programs?

See the [Master's Programs page](/masters-programs).

* * *

### Is the master's program in Computer Science a part of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering?

No. The Masters program in Computer Science is in the Computer Science Department, not the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. They are two entirely separate programs with different application forms and procedures. If you wish to apply for a PhD program in Computer Science, use the SCS Graduate Online Application.

* * *

### Once I begin a master's program in SCS, is it possible to change to another program?

The school allows you to transfer from one program to another after your first year of enrollment, subject to the transfer policy adopted by each program.

* * *

### If I am admitted to a program, can I defer admission?

This policy may vary from program to program. After you are admitted, contact your program coordinator.

* * *

**All test scores must be uploaded (as a PDF) to your application. If the scores are not uploaded by December 15, you will not have access to upload them and your application may not be considered. You should mail your GRE and TOEFL scores when you apply.**

All applicants must take the [Graduate Record Examination](http://www.ets.org/gre/)** (GRE)** general test and have scores. **Send via mail at the time of application.** See individual program requirements for complete details. Refer to the GRE testing schedule to determine test dates. No application will be considered complete until we have received these scores. GRE scores will not be accepted if more than five years old.

If your native language is not English, then you must submit the[Test of English as a Foreign Language](http://www.ets.org/toefl/)(TOEFL). All students need to submit a TOEFL. **No exceptions**.

If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S. and your native language is not English, the TOEFL is still required. However, you may submit an expired test score up to five years old.

If you have not completed a bachelor’s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit a TOEFL **no more than two years old. We will NOT accept an expired score in this case. No exceptions.**

**Send test scores via mail at the time of application.** A successful applicant will normally have a total iBT score of at least 100. We prefer that you take the TOEFL, but we will accept the [International English Language Testing System](https://www.ielts.org/) (IELTS). The same restrictions of expiration dates apply with an IELTS.

**Upload your GRE and TOEFL (if applicable) to your application no later than December 15\. Send the scores via mail at the time of application.**

### Do you accept IELTS?

We prefer that you take the TOEFL, but we will accept the IELTS. Your official score report should be uploaded to your application and sent via mail.

A TOEFL score of 100 is equivalent to an IELTS score of 7.

* * *

### I plan to take the GRE in either November or December. However, the score will not be reported until after the final deadline. What should I do?

We suggest that you plan to take all required tests before December. Since the score report for December tests will not arrive until January and our Admissions Committees usually start their review process in early January, it may cause a delay in the review of your application.

* * *

### What scores should I enter if I have taken the GRE test more than once?

Enter the scores from your most recent test. All scores will appear on the official score report for the committee to review.

* * *

## Education

### I am in a five year program and will be awarded a master's degree. Do I enter this in the Undergraduate or Graduate section of Colleges/Universities?

This information should be entered in both sections.

* * *

### What format do I use to enter my GPA and College/University Point System?

Enter your GPA exactly as given by your College/University, e.g. 3.5, 4.9, 9.6, etc. In the box to right indicate the Point System that your College/University uses, e.g. 4.0, 5.0, 10.0, etc.

* * *

### How many transcripts should I send?

Send ONE copy only of your official transcript from each college or university attended, whether or not you received a degree. If you submit a transcript from a foreign country, you must include an English translation. Do NOT send copies of awards and certificates with the transcript. You are also required to upload an unofficial copy of your transcript in the online application. **Note you are not required to send your transcripts until you have been admitted.**

* * *

### What if my fall semester grades are not on my transcript by the final deadline?

We do not require that you upload a copy of your fall semester grades. If you are admitted, you should send us a final transcript.

* * *

### What happens if my transcripts or test scores arrive before my application?

We do not require that you upload a copy of your fall semester grades. If you are admitted, you will be asked to mail us official updated transcripts.

* * *

### Where do I mail my transcripts?

**No paper copies of your transcript are necessary at the time you apply.** You only need to upload a PDF transcript from each college or university attended, whether or not you received a degree. If you upload a transcript from a foreign country, you must include an English translation. Do NOT upload copies of awards and certificates with the transcript. Note: this must be a copy of an official transcript from the university. (Uploading a personally made PDF of your courses and grades will NOT be accepted.) The Upload button for the transcript will appear once you have saved the College/University information.

* * *

## Resume and Statement

### If I am applying to two programs, can I submit a different Statement of Purpose for each program?

Yes. However, if you are submitting different statements, submit them as one file.

* * *

### I have already uploaded my Resume/Statement of Purpose, but now I have made revisions and would like to submit the new version. What should I do?

You can simply upload the new Resume/Statement of Purpose, even if your application has been submitted. It will override the original one. However, **you may not make any changes to your application after the December 15 deadline**.

* * *

## Recommenders

### If I submit an online application, can my recommenders use the paper recommendation form?

No. Recommenders must submit their letters online. We no longer accept any paper recommendation forms.

* * *

### What should I do if the deadline is approaching or has passed and one or more of my recommenders has not submitted their recommendation?

You may send a reminder email to a recommender (but no more than three times and not after the deadline) from your submitted application. It is your responsibility to make certain that the letters are submitted by the final deadline. Any letters not received by the deadline may not be considered.

* * *

### What if I want to submit more than three letters of recommendation?

Three letters of recommendation are required. However, space is provided for you to submit up to five. At least two should be from faculty or recent employers. Recommenders should know you relatively well and be able to evaluate the quality of your previous work.

* * *

### Who should I ask to write letters of recommendation for me?

The admissions committee wants to know about your ability to do independent research. You should select letter writers who can best speak to that point. Professors who interacted with you extensively in smaller classes are also a good choice. Employers are sometimes appropriate, but letters that are simply character references will not provide good support for your application.

* * *

## Supplemental Information

### I have a paper that has not been submitted for publication or was not accepted for publication, but I would still like for the committee to consider it in my application. Should I list it here?

Yes. However, published papers are viewed more favorably in the admissions process.

* * *

### I have just received notice that a paper listed on my application has been accepted for publication. How can I add this information?

Update this information yourself. The supplemental section will still be available after the deadline.

* * *

## Application Fee

### How much is the application fee?

The application fee is $75 for one program and $50 for each additional program, if you submit your application by noon (12 p.m.) EST December 1\. Between 12:01 p.m. EST on December 1 and noon (12 p.m.) EST on December 15 the application fee increases to $125 for one program and $75 for each additional program.

* * *

### What if I cannot afford to pay the application fee?

We expect all applicants to submit the application fee. However, if you are living in the US and feel that you are financially unable to pay, then you should obtain a letter from your Financial Aid Office explaining your inability to pay and their support of a waiver. Upon receipt of this letter, your fee will be waived.

* * *

### Can I pay the application fee by credit card?

You may pay the fee by credit card or by check. Instructions will be given when you submit your online application. If you do not want to pay by credit card with the online application, you may pay by a check or money order drawn on a U.S. bank and made payable to Carnegie Mellon University. Include your User ID on the check or money order and mail to the Applications Coordinator at the address given above. DO NOT SEND CASH.

* * *

## Check Application

### How and when will I be notified if I am admitted?

Our programs make their decisions at various times during January and February. You will be notified directly by each program that you applied to, as to whether or not you have been admitted. We realize that waiting is very difficult; however, we request that you do not call our offices to inquire about the status of your application. If you have been admitted, you will be notified and asked to submit your hard copy, official transcripts and test scores via mail.

* * *

### How do I track the status of my application?

Do NOT send email to ask the status of your application. Use your user ID and password to access the submitted online application form. Receipt of the required uploaded documents (score reports, transcripts, and letters of recommendation) will be indicated in the corresponding section. Allow two to three weeks past the deadline for all documents to be recorded, as it does take time to process each application. Our offices are closed during the Winter Holiday Break (Dec. 20–Jan. 6) which may further delay processing.
