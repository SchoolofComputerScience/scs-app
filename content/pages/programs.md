# Overview of Programs

The Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science is recognized around the world as a leader in all facets of computer science and robotics education.

Respected international surveys have consistently ranked CMU's graduate programs in computer science among the best in the United States. SCS also is ranked highly in specialty areas such as programming languages, artificial intelligence, systems and theory.

And a survey by the editors of The Wall Street Journal ranked our undergraduate computer science program No. 1 in the United States among corporate recruiters.

### Undergraduate Majors

Most undergraduates in the School of Computer Science are working toward a [bachelor of science in computer science](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/index.html). SCS also offers interdisciplinary majors in [computer science and the arts](http://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bcsaprogram.html), [music and technology](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/mat/) and [computational biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/bs-in-computational-biology.html).

### Undergraduate Additional Majors

SCS offers additional majors in [computer science](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/second.html#major), [human-computer interaction](http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/applying-undergraduate-major), and [robotics](http://major.ri.cmu.edu/). Students wishing to earn a second, or "double," major must obtain their primary bachelor of science degree from another department (typically the Computer Science Department or Electrical and Computer Engineering).

Admissions to all bachelor of science programs are administered through the [Carnegie Mellon Office of Undergraduate Admissions](http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/).

### Undergraduate Minors

The School of Computer Science offers eight undergraduate minors. Accepted and enrolled undergraduate students interested in a minor should contact their academic advisor for more information.

### Graduate Degrees

Graduate admissions are handled on a case-by-case basis by SCS's seven degree-granting departments. Policies and procedures may vary. Please see the departmental program links above, or our [Masters Programs](masters-programs) and [Doctoral Programs](doctoral-programs) pages for more information.

# For International Students

With some of the world's best programs in computer science and robotics, the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science attracts students from many nations. More than 40 percent of our students are natives of countries other than the United States. We pride ourself on creating—together with our students—[a welcoming and supportive environment](http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/forstu/index.html) for their different cultures, languages and traditions. Carnegie Mellon University and SCS offer [a variety of resources](http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/oie/forscho/index.html) to help students interested in earning a degree at our Pittsburgh campus.

## Undergraduate Students

All undergraduate applications are handled by the [Carnegie Mellon Office of Undergraduate Admission](http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/international-admission-requirements). Students from outside the United States are not eligible for Carnegie Mellon University financial aid. Deadlines for international students are the same as those posted for U.S. students. However, international students should submit a pre-application as soon as possible. Students whose native language is not English must complete either the Test of English as a Foreign Language or the International English Language Testing System exam. Scores must be sent no later than Jan. 1. For more information about undergraduate studies at SCS, please see the [Undergraduate Programs](/undergraduate-programs) and [Undergraduate Admissions](/undergraduate-admissions) pages.

## Graduate Students

Admission to master's and doctoral degree programs are handled by the seven degree-granting departments in the School of Computer Science. International students should contact these departments directly to learn about admission requirements and deadlines. Please see the [Masters Programs](/masters-programs), [Masters Admissions](/masters-admissions), [Doctoral Programs](doctoral-programs), and [Doctoral Admissions](/doctoral-admissions) pages for more information specific to your program of interest.</div>
